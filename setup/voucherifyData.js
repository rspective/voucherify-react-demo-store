The brewer consists of 4 light, solid parts made of plastic: water container, spout, dripper, and saucer.\n\nBrewing is simple. Place the dripper with a paper filter on a cup and rinse the filter with hot water. Discard water, pour 15g of medium-ground coffee into the filter, connect all the elements, and pour 150ml of hot water into the water container. That's all you really have to do!\nThe water flows slowly into the spout element and slowly drips into the dripper. After about 3 minutes, 150ml of flavourful brew is ready! This brewing method eliminates the problem of proper water distribution from kettle and gives highly repetitive results.\n\nThe brewer is packed in a well-designed plastic box.",
